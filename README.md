# ChatApp - Scalable LLM Chatbot System

## Overview

ChatApp is a production-ready, scalable chatbot system powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). Designed to support 10,000+ users, it maintains conversation context, integrates advanced LLM capabilities (with retrieval-augmented generation), and uses modern infrastructure for reliability and easy deployment. This system provides a chat interface where users can interact with an LLM, while conversation history is preserved to ensure context-aware responses.

## Features

- **Real-Time Chat Interface:**  
  Users can chat with the LLM in real time through a web or mobile interface.
  
- **Contextual Conversation History:**  
  Conversation histories are maintained to provide context for LLM responses.
  
- **User Authentication:**  
  Secure login using JWT and OAuth2 flows.
  
- **Advanced LLM Integration:**  
  Leverages external LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enriched responses.
  
- **Caching & Analytics:**  
  Uses Redis for caching to improve response times and Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring system health.
  
- **Scalable Architecture:**  
  Designed to support 10,000+ users with a modular design that allows for future enhancements.

## System Architecture

### Architecture Diagram



Explanation of Components & Interactions
Clients & Frontend:
Users interact through a user-friendly interface (web or mobile) that sends HTTP requests to the backend.

Backend API (FastAPI):
Manages business logic, conversation tracking, and orchestrates communication between authentication, database, caching, and LLM services.

Authentication Service:
Secures the system using JWT/OAuth2, ensuring only authenticated users can access API endpoints.

Database (PostgreSQL):
Stores user details, conversation histories, and other persistent data reliably.

Cache (Redis):
Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data and LLM responses.

LLM Service:
Interfaces with external LLM providers to generate natural language responses based on user input.

Knowledge Base (FAISS + Embeddings):
Retrieves relevant context from pre-indexed data to augment LLM responses using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Monitoring & Logging:
Tools like Prometheus and Grafana track system performance and log key metrics to maintain service quality.



Scalability
Handling Increased Load:

Horizontal Scaling: Deploy multiple instances of the backend API and LLM service behind an API Gateway or load balancer.
Vertical Scaling: Increase CPU and memory resources for critical components like the database and caching layer.
Supporting 10,000+ Users:

Use an API Gateway to distribute traffic.
Optimize database performance with read replicas, indexing, and caching.
Design efficient LLM prompts to reduce token usage and latency.
Bottleneck Mitigation:
Address potential bottlenecks (e.g., database or LLM service latency) through caching, asynchronous processing, and resource scaling.
